# **7Lenders: Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Crypto-Backed Fiat Lending Platform**  

## **📌 Introduction**  

**7Lenders** is a **decentralized peer-to-peer (P2P) lending platform** that connects:  
- **🔹 Lenders** who want to earn stable yields in fiat currency (USD, EUR, etc.)  
- **🔹 Borrowers** who need liquidity without selling their cryptocurrency holdings  

Unlike traditional DeFi lending protocols (e.g., Aave, Compound), which only support crypto-to-crypto loans, **7Lenders enables fiat lending backed by crypto collateral**, creating a seamless bridge between traditional finance and decentralized finance (DeFi).  

### **🚀 Why 7Lenders?**  
✔ **Borrowers** retain ownership of their crypto while accessing fiat loans  
✔ **Lenders** earn stable returns without exposure to crypto volatility  
✔ **Fully decentralized** P2P model with smart contract automation  
✔ **Lower fees** than centralized alternatives (BlockFi, Nexo)
